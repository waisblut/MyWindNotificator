/**
 * Since HttpClient,BasicNameValuePairs, etc...  are deprecated.
 * I've searched for a good alternative, and couldn't find any. Eventually ended up writing my own solution, so I decided to share to those who needs it.
 * Main goals: to make it intuitive, short, clean and reasonable.
 * NOTE methods: .prepare(), preparePost(), withData(map) & withData(string) are build to allow caller to chain in different variations, examples:
 * HttpRequest req=new HttpRequest("http://host:port/path");
 * <p/>
 * Example 1: //prepare Http Post request and send to "http://host:port/path" with data params name=Bubu and age=29, return true - if worked
 * req.preparePost().withData("name=Bubu&age=29").send();
 * <p/>
 * Example 2: //prepare http get request,  send to "http://host:port/path" and read server's response as String
 * req.prepare().sendAndReadString();
 * <p/>
 * Example 3: //prepare Http Post request and send to "http://host:port/path" with name=Bubu and age=29 and read server's response as JSONObject
 * HashMap<String, String>params=new HashMap<>();
 * params.put("name", "Groot");
 * params.put("age", "29");
 * req.preparePost().withData(params).sendAndReadJSON();
